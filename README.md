Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was our client. They wanted to create an alternative learning environment to increase the pass rate of driving tests. The system was part physical learning and part learning management system.
What did you do particularly well?
I put a lot of effort into designing the UML diagrams. I remade them several times, making them easier to read and demonstrating the relationships between the system and its components.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would take more time to research the requirements of a system similar to DriverPass'. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Given the simple driver pass transcript, I tried not to add functions or features not specifically outlined by the speakers.  The user will be the consumer of the content, making the experience positive will encourage further use. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by reading over the data several times. I try to create a general outline of functions the system will need, then fill in other attributes as needed.  I want to become more familiar with inheritance and other object-oriented techniques .
